<h1 align="center">üñºÔ∏èüé• Image & Video Face Detection and Tracking</h1>

Welcome to this robust and efficient OpenCV-based project for real-time **face detection** in both images and videos! Whether you want to detect faces in a single image or track multiple faces in a video stream, this project has you covered.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Image Face Detection: Detect faces in any input image using Haar Cascade classifiers.
- Video Face Detection & Tracking: Detect and track faces frame-by-frame in videos or webcam feed.
- Real-time detection with clear bounding boxes highlighting detected faces.
- Easy to customize and extend for your own projects.

---

## üß† How It Works

- Uses OpenCV‚Äôs pre-trained Haar Cascade model (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) to detect faces.
- Processes grayscale images and videos to identify faces.
- Draws green rectangles around detected faces for visualization.

---

## üöÄ Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Face Detection

- Replace the `video_path` variable with the path to your image.
- Run the script, and a window will pop up showing detected faces.
- Press `ESC` to exit.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Video Face Detection & Tracking

- Replace the `video_path` variable with your video file path or use `0` for webcam.
- Processes video frame-by-frame, highlighting faces in real-time.
- Press `ESC` to stop and close the window.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

---

## üì• Getting Started

- Clone the repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KumaranR18/Face-Detection-and-Tracking.git
  cd Face-Detection-and-Tracking
  ```
## Download the Haar Cascade XML file (included or from OpenCV GitHub):

[haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml](https://github.com/KumaranR18/Face-Detection-and-Tracking/blob/main/Face%20Detection%20and%20Tracking/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml)

## Run the scripts:

1. For image detection:

``` bash
python Image Face Detection.py
```
2. For video detection:

```bash
python Video Face Detection and Tracking.py
```
